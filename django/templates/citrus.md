## Summary
- **Situation**: Previously, each Naver search developer maintained their own CI/CD pipeline, which was time-consuming. I proposed CitruS to streamline this process and save developer's time.
- **Task**: Create a CI/CD builder platform to simplify and standardize the CI/CD setup process.
- **Action**: Developed a setup wizard that includes Docker image configuration, Jenkins setup, and SonarQube integration.
- **Result**: Enabled Naver search developers to create their own CI/CD pipelines within minutes, significantly saving each developer's time. Additionally, server maintenance costs were reduced by using centralized Jenkins and SonarQube.
- **Tech Stack**: Gin(Golang), Vue.js(Typescript), Django(Python), MariaDB, Bootstrap, Wetty, Jenkins, Sonarqube, Kubernetes
- **Duration**: 2018.11 ~ 2024.01
- **Member**: 4
