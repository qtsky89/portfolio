## Summary
- **Situation**: Naver search developers maintained their own CI/CD pipeline. I suggested a new platform to save time.
- **Task**: Make CI/CD builder platform.
- **Action**: Made create wizard page with a docker image setting, a Jenkins setting, a Sonarqube setting.
- **Result**: More than a hundred users use this platform every day. Naver search developers can make their own CI/CD pipeline within a few minutes. Saved a week of every developer's time. And saved server maintenance costs by 10%, because I used centralized Jenkins and Sonarqube.

- **Duration**: 2018.11 ~ 2024.01, 4 members
